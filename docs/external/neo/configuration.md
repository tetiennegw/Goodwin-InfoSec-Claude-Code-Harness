| `USAGE_LIMITS.warningThreshold` | 0.80 | Usage fraction at which a warning is sent to the client |

### API Key Management

API keys can be managed in two ways depending on your deployment:

**Option A — Cosmos DB + Key Vault (recommended for production)**

When both `COSMOS_ENDPOINT` and `KEY_VAULT_URL` are configured, API keys are stored encrypted in a dedicated Cosmos DB container (`api-keys`). Keys are encrypted at rest using an RSA key in Azure Key Vault and looked up via SHA-256 hash for fast authentication. Admins create and revoke keys through the Settings page (`/settings` > API Keys tab).

| Environment Variable | Required | Description |
|---------------------|----------|-------------|
| `COSMOS_ENDPOINT` | Yes | Cosmos DB endpoint (same as chat persistence) |
| `KEY_VAULT_URL` | Yes | Key Vault URL (same as tool integrations) |
| `KEY_VAULT_KEY_NAME` | No | RSA key name for API key encryption (default: `neo-api-key-encryption`) |
| `SUPER_ADMIN_IDS` | No | Comma-separated owner IDs that can view/revoke all keys across all admins |

Each key record includes: label, role, creation date, optional expiration (max 2 years), creator, revocation status, and last-used timestamp. Keys are encrypted with RSA-OAEP before storage. The raw key is shown exactly once on creation and cannot be retrieved again.

Run `scripts/provision-cosmos-db.ps1` to create the `api-keys` container, and `scripts/provision-key-vault.ps1` to create the RSA encryption key and assign the `Key Vault Crypto Officer` role.

**Option B — JSON file (fallback for development or simple deployments)**

When Cosmos DB is not configured, API keys fall back to `web/api-keys.json`:

```json
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "key": "your-secret-api-key",
      "role": "admin",
      "label": "SOC Team Admin Key"
    },
    {
      "key": "another-secret-api-key",
      "role": "reader",
      "label": "Analyst Read-Only Key"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each key entry has:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `key` | The secret token. Generate with `openssl rand -base64 24`. |
| `role` | `admin` (full access) or `reader` (read-only tools only). |
| `label` | Human-readable name shown in logs and session ownership. |

An example file is provided at `web/api-keys.example.json`.

**Hot-reload**: The server watches `api-keys.json` for changes. You can add or remove keys without restarting the server.

**Security**: Keep `api-keys.json` out of version control. Add it to `.gitignore` if it contains production keys. For production deployments, use the Cosmos DB option instead.

### Entra ID Setup (Web Server)

To enable Entra ID authentication on the web server (for browser-based access):

1. Register an application in the Azure portal (see [Azure App Registration](#azure-app-registration)).
2. Add a **Web** redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/microsoft-entra-id` (adjust host for production).
3. Create a client secret.
4. Set the environment variables:
   ```bash
   AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_ID=<client-id>
   AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_SECRET=<client-secret>
   AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_ISSUER=https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>/v2.0
   ```

**Role mapping**: Users with the `Admin` app role in Entra ID get the `admin` role in Neo. All other users get `reader`.

### Mock Mode

When `MOCK_MODE=true` (the default), all tool calls return simulated data. This is useful for:

- Testing the CLI/web interface without Azure credentials
- Development and demo purposes
- CI/CD pipelines

Set `MOCK_MODE=false` and provide Azure credentials to execute real Sentinel queries, Defender actions, and Entra ID operations.

### CLI Downloads Storage

CLI installer files are hosted in Azure Blob Storage, allowing the CLI to be updated independently of web app deployments. Upload a new installer to the storage container — no redeployment needed.

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `CLI_STORAGE_ACCOUNT` | For downloads | Azure Storage account name (e.g. `neostorage`) |
| `CLI_STORAGE_CONTAINER` | No | Blob container name (default: `cli-releases`) |

**Authentication**: Uses `DefaultAzureCredential` from `@azure/identity` — the same pattern as Cosmos DB. In Azure, this resolves to the App Service's system-assigned managed identity. Locally, it falls back to Azure CLI login (`az login`).

**Required RBAC role**: The identity must have **Storage Blob Data Reader** on the storage account or container.

If `CLI_STORAGE_ACCOUNT` is not set, the `/api/downloads/[filename]` route returns a 503 error.

**CLI auto-update version endpoint**: The `GET /api/cli/version` route also reads from the storage account to compute a SHA-256 hash of the installer blob. The hash is cached in memory (keyed by the blob's ETag) so subsequent requests are fast. When you upload a new installer, the ETag changes and the hash is recomputed on the next request. The CLI verifies this hash after downloading to ensure integrity. To update the CLI version number, change the `version` field in `web/lib/download-config.ts` and redeploy the web server.

<a id="csv-uploads"></a>
### File Uploads (Web)

The web chat accepts image, PDF, and CSV attachments up to 5 files per message. All three types use Azure Blob Storage with Managed Identity auth, sharing the same storage account as the CLI downloads container.

| Container | Env Var | Content | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Images + PDFs | `UPLOAD_STORAGE_CONTAINER` | JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, PDF | Attachment blobs are persisted with blob URLs in the conversation document for history replay. |
| CSV attachments | `CSV_UPLOAD_STORAGE_CONTAINER` (default `neo-csv-uploads`) | CSVs exceeding 500 rows or 100 KB | Inline CSVs never touch blob storage — they are embedded directly in the conversation. |

**How CSVs are handled**

- **Small CSVs (≤ 500 rows AND ≤ 100 KB)** are classified inline: parsed server-side, wrapped in a `<csv_attachment mode="inline">` text block, and sent to Claude directly. Nothing is uploaded.
- **Large CSVs** are uploaded to the `neo-csv-uploads` container under `{conversationId}/{csvId}/{filename}`, and a `CSVReference` record is appended to the conversation's `csvAttachments[]` field in Cosmos. A new `query_csv` tool is conditionally registered for that conversation, giving Claude read-only SQL (`SELECT` / `WITH` / `PRAGMA table_info(csv)`) against an in-memory `sql.js` (SQLite-in-WebAssembly) copy of the file. Queries are capped at 100 rows per call.
- Per-conversation cap: 10 reference-mode CSVs. An 11th upload returns a 409 with a message asking the user to start a new conversation.
- Hard limits: 50 MB per file, 200 columns per file. Wider files are rejected at upload time.
- Binary content (null-byte buffers) is rejected before parsing, even with a `.csv` extension and a permissive MIME type.

**Provisioning (Azure CLI)**

Create both containers in the same storage account referenced by `CLI_STORAGE_ACCOUNT`:

```powershell
# Create the image/PDF upload container
az storage container create `
    --name neo-uploads `
    --account-name neoclireleases

# Create the CSV upload container
az storage container create `
    --name neo-csv-uploads `
    --account-name neoclireleases

# Grant the App Service's managed identity read/write on the upload containers.
# Storage Blob Data Contributor is required because the app both reads and writes.
$principalId = az webapp identity show `
    --name neo-web `
    --resource-group neo-rg `
    --query principalId -o tsv

az role assignment create `
    --role "Storage Blob Data Contributor" `
    --assignee $principalId `
    --scope "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/neo-rg/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/neoclireleases/blobServices/default/containers/neo-uploads"

az role assignment create `
    --role "Storage Blob Data Contributor" `
    --assignee $principalId `
    --scope "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/neo-rg/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/neoclireleases/blobServices/default/containers/neo-csv-uploads"
```

**Cleanup lifecycle**

Blobs in both containers are tied to the parent conversation document in Cosmos. Because Cosmos TTL deletion is not atomic with blob deletion, a daily Azure Function (`csv-cleanup`) sweeps orphaned blobs whose parent conversation no longer exists. The function runs at 03:00 UTC, lists blob prefixes in the CSV container, checks each conversation ID against Cosmos DB, and deletes blobs for conversations that have been TTL'd. It fails closed — if a Cosmos lookup errors (e.g., throttled), it skips deletion rather than risk removing live data.

Deploy the cleanup function via `scripts/provision-csv-cleanup.ps1` (see [Provision CSV Cleanup Function](#provision-csv-cleanup-function) under Azure Deployment).

<a id="triage-api"></a>
### Alert Triage API

The triage API (`POST /api/triage`) enables automated alert investigation from Azure Logic Apps. Logic Apps submit structured security alerts; Neo investigates via its skills framework and returns a JSON verdict (benign / escalate / inconclusive).

**Authentication**: The Logic App authenticates via Managed Identity using an app-only Entra token. Neo checks the `idtyp === "app"` claim and assigns the dedicated `triage` role, which is scoped to read-only investigation tools (no destructive actions).

**Cosmos DB**: Triage runs are persisted in a `triageRuns` container. Add it to your existing Cosmos DB account using `scripts/provision-cosmos-db.ps1` (it provisions all containers idempotently).

**Roles**: The `triage` role is a new third role alongside `admin` and `reader`. It has the same tool access as `reader` (no destructive tools) but is assigned only to service principals, not interactive users.

**Environment variables**: See the env var table above for all `TRIAGE_*` variables. Key settings:

| Setting | Default | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `TRIAGE_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` | 0.80 | Minimum confidence for auto-close |
| `TRIAGE_SEVERITY_ALLOWLIST` | All | Severities eligible for benign verdict |
| `TRIAGE_DEDUP_WINDOW_MS` | 24 hours | Idempotency window |
| `TRIAGE_CALLER_ALLOWLIST` | Empty (all allowed) | Restrict callers to specific skills |

**Setting up the Logic App caller**:

1. Create a Logic App with a system-assigned Managed Identity.
2. In Neo's Entra app registration (same one used for browser auth), go to **App roles** and create a role (e.g., `Triage.Run`, value `Triage.Run`, allowed member types: `Applications`).
3. Go to **Enterprise applications** → find your app → **Users and groups** → **Add assignment** → select the Logic App's service principal → assign the `Triage.Run` role.
4. In the Logic App's HTTP action, set:
   - **Method**: POST
   - **URI**: `https://neo.companyname.com/api/triage`
   - **Authentication**: Managed Identity
   - **Audience**: `api://<your-neo-app-client-id>`
5. The Logic App's Managed Identity token will include `idtyp: "app"`, which Neo uses to identify it as a service principal.

**Per-caller skill restrictions** (optional): If you have multiple Logic Apps and want to limit which alert types each can triage, set `TRIAGE_CALLER_ALLOWLIST`:

```bash
# Format: appId1:skill1,skill2;appId2:*
# * = all skills allowed
TRIAGE_CALLER_ALLOWLIST="12345678-...:defender-endpoint-triage;87654321-...:*"
```

When the allowlist is empty (default), all authenticated service principals can invoke any triage skill.

**Circuit breaker**: If >30% of triage runs fail within 15 minutes, the breaker trips and all requests return `verdict: escalate` until auto-reset (30 min) or manual reset via `POST /api/admin/triage/circuit-breaker/reset` (admin auth required).

**Monitoring**: All triage runs are logged to the same Event Hub pipeline as interactive conversations. Filter by `channel: "triage"` in your dashboards. Each run includes: alert ID, product, alert type, verdict, confidence, skill used, and duration.

### Token Usage Budgets

Neo enforces per-user token budgets to control API costs. Two rolling windows are checked before each agent loop call:

| Window | Default Limit | Env Var |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| 2-hour | 670,000 input tokens (~$10 Opus) | `USAGE_LIMIT_2H_INPUT_TOKENS` |
| 1-week | 6,700,000 input tokens (~$100 Opus) | `USAGE_LIMIT_WEEKLY_INPUT_TOKENS` |

These defaults are safety guardrails calibrated to Opus pricing. Adjust via environment variables without rebuilding.

**How it works**:
- Before each API call, the server checks the user's accumulated token usage in both windows.
- At 80% of either limit, a warning is included in the NDJSON response stream.
- At 100%, the request is rejected with a 429 status and a message indicating which limit was exceeded.
- Usage data is stored in the `usage-logs` Cosmos DB container with a 90-day TTL.
- Users can check their current usage via `GET /api/usage`.
- Admins can view per-user usage and reset limits in Settings > Usage Limits.

**Tuning**: Set `USAGE_LIMIT_2H_INPUT_TOKENS` and `USAGE_LIMIT_WEEKLY_INPUT_TOKENS` in `.env` or your app settings. Values are in input tokens. To convert to approximate cost: multiply by the per-token input price for your default model (Sonnet: $3/M tokens, Opus: $15/M tokens).

**Disabling enforcement**: Set `ENABLE_USAGE_LIMITS=false` to turn off all token budget enforcement while keeping usage tracking intact. Useful for:
- Demos where you don't want the agent to stop mid-presentation
- User onboarding where new users need to explore without hitting limits
- Incident response where SOC analysts need uninterrupted access

When disabled, the Settings > Usage page shows a "Usage limits are currently disabled" notice but continues to display consumption data. Per-user window overrides (`USAGE_LIMIT_2H_INPUT_TOKENS`, `USAGE_LIMIT_WEEKLY_INPUT_TOKENS`) have no effect while the global toggle is off. Restart the server to apply changes.

## CLI Configuration

### Config File

The CLI stores credentials at `~/.neo/config.json`. Sensitive values (API keys, tokens) are encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM with a machine-derived key.

You should never need to edit this file manually. Use the `auth` commands instead:

```bash
node src/index.js auth login   # Configure credentials
node src/index.js auth logout  # Clear Entra ID credentials
node src/index.js auth status  # View current config
```

The config file is automatically created on first `auth login` with permissions `600` (owner read/write only). The `~/.neo/` directory is created with permissions `700`.

### Authentication Priority

The CLI resolves authentication in this order (first match wins):

1. `--api-key <key>` flag (dev-only — visible in process table)
2. `NEO_API_KEY` environment variable
3. Saved API key in `~/.neo/config.json`
4. Saved Entra ID tokens in `~/.neo/config.json`

### API Key Auth (CLI)

The simplest authentication method. Get an API key from your admin, then:

**Option A — Save to config (recommended)**:
```bash
node src/index.js auth login --api-key <your-key>
npm start
```

**Option B — Environment variable**:
```bash
export NEO_API_KEY=<your-key>
npm start
```

**Option C — Inline flag (dev-only)**:
```bash
npm start -- --api-key <your-key>
```

> Note: Option C exposes the key in the process table (`ps aux`). Use it only during local development.

### Entra ID Auth (CLI)

Browser-based login using OAuth2 Authorization Code with PKCE. No client secret required.

**Prerequisites**: Your admin must configure Entra ID on the Neo web server and add `http://localhost:4000/callback` as a redirect URI under "Mobile and desktop applications" in the Entra ID app registration (see [CLI Public Client Setup](#cli-public-client-setup)).

**Login** (no flags needed):
```bash
node src/index.js auth login
```

The CLI auto-discovers the tenant ID and client ID from the Neo server's `/api/auth/discover` endpoint. This means regular users don't need to know any app registration details — they just run `auth login` and the server provides the configuration.

This will:
1. Discover Entra ID configuration from the Neo server.
2. Open your browser to the Microsoft login page.
3. Start a temporary local server on port 4000 for the callback.
4. Exchange the authorization code for tokens.
5. Save encrypted tokens and discovered config to `~/.neo/config.json`.

After login, just run `npm start` — the CLI will use the saved tokens and refresh them automatically.

**Override tenant ID** (optional — only if your admin tells you to):
```bash
node src/index.js auth login --tenant-id <tenant-id>
```

**Logout**:
```bash
node src/index.js auth logout
```

**Check status**:
```bash
node src/index.js auth status
```

You can also set tenant and client IDs via environment variables:
```bash
export NEO_TENANT_ID=<tenant-id>
export NEO_CLIENT_ID=<client-id>
node src/index.js auth login
```

**Discovery endpoint**: The CLI fetches `GET {server-url}/api/auth/discover` to resolve Entra ID configuration. The endpoint returns `{ tenantId, clientId }` from the server's environment variables. This is an unauthenticated endpoint since the values are public identifiers, not secrets.

### Server URL

The CLI defaults to `http://localhost:3000`. Override it for remote servers:

**Option A — Save to config**:

Currently set via the config file at `~/.neo/config.json` or environment variable. The `auth login` commands use the default.

**Option B — Environment variable**:
```bash
export NEO_SERVER=https://neo.example.com
npm start
```

**Option C — Flag**:
```bash
npm start -- --server https://neo.example.com
```

**Option D — Default via `NEO_SERVER_URL`**:

Set `NEO_SERVER_URL` to change the default server URL for all CLI instances that don't have an explicit `NEO_SERVER` or `--server` override. This is useful for deployed installations where the server URL is fixed:
```bash
NEO_SERVER_URL=https://neo.example.com
```

**Security**: HTTPS is required for non-localhost URLs. The CLI will reject `http://` connections to remote hosts.

Priority: `--server` flag > `NEO_SERVER` env var > config file (`serverUrl`) > `NEO_SERVER_URL` env var > `http://localhost:3000`

### Environment Variables (CLI)

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `NEO_SERVER` | Server URL override (highest env var priority) |
| `NEO_SERVER_URL` | Default server URL when `NEO_SERVER` is not set (default: `http://localhost:3000`) |
| `NEO_API_KEY` | API key for authentication |
| `NEO_TENANT_ID` | Entra ID tenant ID |
| `NEO_CLIENT_ID` | Entra ID client/application ID |
| `DEBUG` | Set to any value to enable verbose error output |

## Azure App Registration

Neo uses two separate concerns in Azure AD:

1. **Server app registration** — used by the web server to authenticate users and call Azure APIs.
2. **Public client redirect** — added to the same app registration to allow CLI browser login.

### Server App Registration

1. Go to **Azure Portal > Microsoft Entra ID > App registrations > New registration**.
2. Name it (e.g., "Neo Security Agent").
3. Set **Supported account types** to "Accounts in this organizational directory only".
4. Under **Redirect URIs**, add a **Web** platform URI:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/microsoft-entra-id
   ```
   For production, replace with your actual domain.
5. Go to **Certificates & secrets > New client secret**. Copy the value and set it as `AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_SECRET`.
6. Copy the **Application (client) ID** and set it as `AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_ID`.
7. Set the **Issuer** to `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>/v2.0`.

**App roles** (for RBAC):

1. Go to **App roles > Create app role**:
   - Display name: `Admin`
   - Value: `Admin`
   - Allowed member types: Users/Groups
2. Assign the `Admin` role to users or groups under **Enterprise applications > Neo Security Agent > Users and groups**.
3. Users without the `Admin` role automatically get `reader` permissions.

**API permissions** (for tool execution when `MOCK_MODE=false`):

The app registration used for tool execution (`AZURE_CLIENT_ID`) needs these application permissions:

| API | Permission | Used by |
|-----|-----------|---------|
| Microsoft Graph | `User.Read.All` | `get_user_info` |
| Microsoft Graph | `User.ReadWrite.All` | `reset_user_password` |
| Microsoft Graph | `IdentityRiskyUser.ReadWrite.All` | `dismiss_user_risk` |
| Microsoft Graph | `Policy.Read.All` | `list_ca_policies`, `get_ca_policy`, `list_named_locations` |
| Microsoft Graph | `Mail.Read` | `search_user_messages` |
| Microsoft Graph | `Mail.Send` | `report_message_as_phishing` |
| Microsoft Threat Protection | `Machine.Read.All` | `get_machine_isolation_status`, `isolate_machine`, `unisolate_machine` |
| Microsoft Threat Protection | `Machine.Isolate` | `isolate_machine`, `unisolate_machine` |
| Microsoft Threat Protection | `Ti.ReadWrite.All` | `block_indicator`, `import_indicators`, `list_indicators`, `delete_indicator` |
| Log Analytics API | (workspace-level RBAC) | `run_sentinel_kql` |

Add these under **API permissions > Add a permission > Microsoft Graph > Application permissions** (and similarly for Microsoft Threat Protection).

### CLI Public Client Setup

To enable Entra ID login from the CLI, add a public client redirect URI to the same app registration:

1. Go to **Azure Portal > App registrations > Neo Security Agent > Authentication**.
2. Click **Add a platform > Mobile and desktop applications**.
3. Enter the custom redirect URI:
   ```
   http://localhost:4000/callback
   ```
4. Under **Advanced settings**, set **Allow public client flows** to **Yes**.
5. Click **Save**.

No client secret is needed for the CLI — it uses PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange).

---

## Third-Party Integrations

Neo supports integrations with external security platforms beyond Microsoft. Each integration requires an API token stored either as an environment variable or in Azure Key Vault (recommended for production). When `KEY_VAULT_URL` is configured, secrets are read from Key Vault first with env var fallback.

Manage integration secrets in the web UI at **Settings > Integrations** (admin-only), or set them in `.env` / Key Vault directly.

### Lansweeper (Asset Management)

Provides the `lookup_asset` tool — look up IT assets by hostname, IP, or serial number. Returns asset identity, ownership tags (Business Owner, BIA Tier, Role, Technology Owner), primary user, and vulnerability summary.

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `LANSWEEPER_API_TOKEN` | Personal Access Token from Lansweeper Settings > Developer Tools |
| `LANSWEEPER_SITE_ID` | Lansweeper site identifier (GUID) for API queries |

**API endpoint**: `https://api.lansweeper.com/api/v2/graphql`

### Abnormal Security (Email Threat Detection)

Provides three tools for email threat investigation and response:

| Tool | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `search_abnormal_messages` | Read-only | Search messages by sender, recipient, subject, attachment, judgement, time range |
| `remediate_abnormal_messages` | Destructive | Bulk delete, move to inbox, or submit messages to Detection360 |
| `get_abnormal_remediation_status` | Read-only | Check status of a previously submitted remediation action |

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `ABNORMAL_API_TOKEN` | Abnormal Security REST API bearer token for Search & Respond |

**API endpoint**: `https://api.abnormalplatform.com`

### ThreatLocker (Application Allowlisting)

Provides tools for reviewing and actioning application approval requests.

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `THREATLOCKER_API_KEY` | ThreatLocker Portal API key |
| `THREATLOCKER_INSTANCE` | Portal API instance name (e.g., `us`) |
| `THREATLOCKER_ORG_ID` | Managed organization GUID |

**API endpoint**: `https://portalapi.<instance>.threatlocker.com/portalapi`

## Skills Configuration

### Skills Directory

Skills are markdown files stored in `web/skills/`. The server watches this directory and reloads automatically when files change (no restart needed).

```
web/skills/
  tor-login-investigation.md
  phishing-response.md
  insider-threat-triage.md
```

Each `.md` file in this directory is parsed as a skill. The filename (without extension) becomes the skill ID.

**ID format**: Skill IDs must be 2–60 characters, lowercase alphanumeric with hyphens, matching `/^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9]$/`. Examples: `tor-login-investigation`, `phishing-response`.

Skills can also be managed via the REST API (see [User Guide — Managing Skills](user-guide.md#managing-skills-admin)).

### Skill File Format

Each skill file uses markdown with specific headings:

```markdown
# Skill: TOR Login Investigation

## Description

Investigate a user account flagged for sign-in activity from a TOR exit node.

## Required Tools

- run_sentinel_kql
- get_user_info
- search_xdr_by_host

## Required Role

reader

## Parameters

- upn
- timeframe

## Steps

Follow these steps in order...
```

| Section | Required | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `# Skill: <name>` | Yes | The skill name. Must be the first `#` heading. |
| `## Description` | Yes | Short description shown in skill listings. |
| `## Required Tools` | No | List of tool names the skill uses. Each must be a valid tool. Skills that reference destructive tools must have `Required Role` set to `admin`. |
| `## Required Role` | No | `reader` (default) or `admin`. Controls which users see this skill. |
| `## Parameters` | No | List of parameter names the skill accepts. These are substituted in the skill content. |
| `## Steps` | No | The investigation steps. This is the main body injected into the agent's system prompt. |

**Validation rules**:
- Skills without a name or description are skipped with a warning.
- Skills referencing unknown tools are skipped with a warning.
- Skills that use destructive tools (`reset_user_password`, `isolate_machine`, `unisolate_machine`) but have `Required Role` set to `reader` are rejected.

### Mapping Alert Types to Triage Skills

When the triage API receives an alert, it resolves which skill to run using a dispatch table in `web/lib/triage-dispatch.ts`. The table maps `product:alertType` keys to skill IDs. If no specific mapping exists, the `generic-alert-triage` catch-all skill is used.

**Current dispatch table**:

| Key (`product:alertType`) | Skill ID | Description |
|---------------------------|----------|-------------|
| `DefenderXDR:DefenderEndpoint.SuspiciousProcess` | `defender-endpoint-triage` | Defender for Endpoint process alerts |
| *(any other combination)* | `generic-alert-triage` | Generic catch-all for unmapped alert types |

**Adding a new mapping**:

1. Create a new skill file in `web/skills/` (e.g., `entra-risky-signin-triage.md`):

```markdown
# Skill: Entra Risky Sign-In Triage

## Description

Investigate Entra ID Protection alerts for risky sign-in activity.

## Required Tools

- run_sentinel_kql
- get_user_info

## Required Role

reader

## Parameters

- alertId
- username

## Steps

1. Retrieve the user's profile and risk state via `get_user_info`.
2. Query SigninLogs for the flagged sign-in event and surrounding activity:
   - Check source IP geolocation and whether it matches known user locations
   - Check for impossible travel (sign-ins from distant locations within a short window)
   - Check MFA completion status
3. Query AADRiskEvents for correlated risk detections on this user.
4. Check for post-sign-in suspicious activity (new inbox rules, consent grants, privilege escalation).
5. Formulate verdict:
   - **benign**: Known location, MFA passed, no post-sign-in anomalies
   - **escalate**: Unfamiliar location, MFA bypassed, or suspicious post-sign-in activity
   - **inconclusive**: Insufficient data to determine
```

2. Add the mapping to the dispatch table in `web/lib/triage-dispatch.ts`:

```typescript
const TRIAGE_SKILL_MAP: Record<string, string> = {
  "DefenderXDR:DefenderEndpoint.SuspiciousProcess": "defender-endpoint-triage",
  "EntraIDProtection:riskySignIn": "entra-risky-signin-triage",  // new
};
```

3. The skill hot-reloads from disk — no restart needed for the skill file. The dispatch table change requires a redeploy.

**How the key is constructed**: The triage API caller sets `source.product` and `source.alertType` in the request body. The dispatch table looks up `"${product}:${alertType}"`. The `product` must be one of: `Sentinel`, `DefenderXDR`, `EntraIDProtection`, `Purview`, `DefenderForCloudApps`. The `alertType` is a free-form string set by the Logic App (typically the alert product name or rule name from Sentinel).

**Matching in the Logic App**: To route a specific Sentinel analytics rule to a dedicated skill, set `source.alertType` in the Logic App request body to a value that matches the dispatch table key. For example, if you want all "Risky sign-in" alerts to use the `entra-risky-signin-triage` skill:

```json
{
  "source": {
    "product": "EntraIDProtection",
    "alertType": "riskySignIn",
    "severity": "@{triggerBody()?['properties']?['severity']}",
    "alertId": "@{triggerBody()?['properties']?['incidentNumber']}",
    "detectionTime": "@{triggerBody()?['properties']?['createdTimeUtc']}"
  },
  "payload": { ... },
  "context": { ... }
}
```

**Generic fallback**: If the `product:alertType` key has no entry in the dispatch table, the `generic-alert-triage` skill is used. This skill is deliberately conservative — it leans toward `escalate` or `inconclusive` when uncertain. To get the best auto-close rates, create dedicated skills for your highest-volume alert types and add them to the dispatch table.

**Per-caller skill restrictions**: If you have multiple Logic Apps and want to limit which skills each can invoke, use the `TRIAGE_CALLER_ALLOWLIST` env var:

```bash
# Format: appId1:skill1,skill2;appId2:*
# * = all skills allowed
TRIAGE_CALLER_ALLOWLIST="12345678-...:defender-endpoint-triage;87654321-...:*"
```

## Chat Persistence (Cosmos DB)

When `COSMOS_ENDPOINT` is set and `MOCK_MODE` is `false`, Neo persists conversations in Azure Cosmos DB. This enables conversation history in the web UI sidebar, resumable sessions across server restarts, and a 90-day retention window for audit purposes.

### How it works

- **Partition key**: `/ownerId` — the immutable AAD Object ID (`oid` claim) from Entra ID. This ensures each user's conversations are co-located for efficient queries and isolated from other users.
- **Session abstraction**: A `SessionStore` interface abstracts the storage backend. When Cosmos DB is configured, a `CosmosSessionStore` adapter is used. Otherwise, an `InMemorySessionStore` provides the same interface with no persistence.
- **Auto-titling**: After the first assistant response in a new conversation, a Claude Haiku call generates a short title (max 8 words). Users can rename conversations manually.
- **Idle timeout**: Sessions idle for 30 minutes are treated as expired for active use, but the conversation document remains in Cosmos DB.
- **Document TTL**: Conversations have a 90-day TTL. Cosmos DB automatically deletes expired documents.
- **Concurrency**: Message appends use ETag-based optimistic concurrency to prevent lost updates.

### Authentication

Cosmos DB access uses `DefaultAzureCredential` from `@azure/identity` — no connection strings or keys. In Azure, this uses Managed Identity. Locally, it uses your Azure CLI login (`az login`).

The identity used must have the **Cosmos DB Built-in Data Contributor** role on the Cosmos DB account.

### Provisioning

Use the provisioning script to create the Cosmos DB infrastructure:

```powershell
# Default — creates neo-cosmos-db account, neo-db database, conversations container
./scripts/provision-cosmos-db.ps1

# Custom account name and region
./scripts/provision-cosmos-db.ps1 -AccountName "neo-prod-cosmos" -Location "westus2"
```

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `-ResourceGroupName` | `neo-rg` | Azure Resource Group name (reuses existing) |
| `-AccountName` | `neo-cosmos-db` | Cosmos DB account name (globally unique) |
| `-DatabaseName` | `neo-db` | Database name |
| `-ContainerName` | `conversations` | Container name |
| `-MappingsContainerName` | `teams-mappings` | Teams mapping container name |
| `-UsageContainerName` | `usage-logs` | Token usage tracking container name |
| `-Location` | `eastus` | Azure region |
| `-PartitionKeyPath` | `/ownerId` | Partition key path |

The script creates the account in serverless capacity mode (pay-per-request), creates the `conversations` container (partition key `/ownerId`), the `teams-mappings` container (partition key `/id`), and the `usage-logs` container (partition key `/userId`) — all with 90-day TTL — and assigns the **Cosmos DB Built-in Data Contributor** role to the currently logged-in Azure CLI user.

### Adding the Teams Mappings Container to an Existing Cosmos DB

If your Cosmos DB was provisioned before the Teams integration was added, the `teams-mappings` container will be missing. Use the migration script to add it:

```powershell
# Default — adds teams-mappings to neo-cosmos / neo-db
./scripts/add-teams-mappings-container.ps1

# Custom account name
./scripts/add-teams-mappings-container.ps1 -AccountName "neo-cosmos-prod"
```

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `-ResourceGroupName` | `neo-rg` | Azure Resource Group name |
| `-AccountName` | `neo-cosmos` | Existing Cosmos DB account name |
| `-DatabaseName` | `neo-db` | Existing database name |
| `-ContainerName` | `teams-mappings` | Container name to create |
| `-DefaultTtl` | `7776000` (90 days) | Document TTL in seconds |

The script verifies the account and database exist before creating the container. It is idempotent — safe to re-run if the container already exists. No `.env` changes are needed since the Teams mappings container uses the same `COSMOS_ENDPOINT` as conversations.

After provisioning, set the endpoint in your `.env`:

```bash
COSMOS_ENDPOINT=https://<account-name>.documents.azure.com:443/
```

### Usage Logs Container

The `usage-logs` container stores per-API-call token usage records for budget enforcement and cost tracking.

- **Partition key**: `/userId` — the immutable AAD Object ID from Entra ID.
- **Document TTL**: 90 days (same as conversations).
- **Created automatically** by `scripts/provision-cosmos-db.ps1`.

Each document contains the model used, input/output token counts, cache metrics, session ID, and timestamp. The `GET /api/usage` endpoint queries this container to return usage summaries for the authenticated user.

Without Cosmos DB configured, usage tracking and budget enforcement are disabled (all requests are allowed).

### Conversation Schema (v1 vs v2)

Neo ships with two conversation schemas in parallel. The newer **v2** schema was introduced to remove the 2 MB per-conversation Cosmos ceiling that v1 bumped into for long-running incident-response sessions with large KQL results. A runtime env var (`NEO_CONVERSATION_STORE_MODE`) selects which schema is active, and a dedicated migration script moves data between them.

| | v1 (default) | v2 |
|---|---|---|
| Cosmos container | `conversations` | `neo-conversations-v2` |
| Partition key | `/ownerId` | `/conversationId` |
| Document shape | One doc per conversation (root + full message array inline) | Root doc + append-only per-turn docs + blob-ref docs (+ future checkpoint docs) |
| Size ceiling | 2 MB per conversation (hard Cosmos limit) | No practical ceiling — oversized tool results (>256 KB by default) offload to Azure Blob Storage and are resolved lazily via `get_full_tool_result` |
| Per-turn RU cost | Full-doc replace on every append | Single turn-doc create + narrow root patch via `TransactionalBatch` |
| TTL granularity | Whole conversation (90-day default) | Per-doc, inherited from root's `retentionClass` (`standard-7y` default; also `legal-hold`, `client-matter`, `transient`) |

The external `SessionStore` and `Conversation` shapes are identical in both modes — all schema knowledge is contained inside `lib/conversation-store.ts` and `lib/conversation-store-v2.ts`. Route handlers, the agent loop, and the Teams bot don't know which schema is active.

#### Mode selector

`NEO_CONVERSATION_STORE_MODE` takes one of four values:

| Mode | Reads | Writes |
|------|-------|--------|
| `v1` (default) | v1 container | v1 container |
| `dual-write` | v1 container | v1 AND v2 containers |
| `dual-read` | v2 first; v1 fallback on miss | v2 container; v1 fallback on missing root |
| `v2` | v2 container | v2 container |

The transition modes (`dual-write` and `dual-read`) let you migrate without a user-visible outage. Under `dual-write`, v1 is authoritative for reads while v2 catches up in parallel; any v2 write failure emits a `conversation_dual_write_divergence` log event for operator monitoring. Under `dual-read`, v2 is authoritative with automatic fallback to v1 for conversations that haven't been migrated yet.

#### v2-specific env vars

```bash
NEO_CONVERSATION_STORE_MODE=v1                         # v1 | dual-write | dual-read | v2
NEO_CONVERSATIONS_V2_CONTAINER=neo-conversations-v2    # Cosmos container name
NEO_TOOL_RESULT_BLOB_CONTAINER=neo-tool-results        # Azure Blob container for offloaded tool results
NEO_BLOB_OFFLOAD_THRESHOLD_BYTES=262144                # Size threshold for blob offload (256 KB default)
NEO_BLOB_RESOLVE_MAX_BYTES=20971520                    # Upper cap for lazy-resolve (20 MB default)
NEO_RETENTION_CLASS_DEFAULT=standard-7y                # standard-7y | legal-hold | client-matter | transient
```

The blob container requires a lifecycle policy on the `staging/` prefix (reap after 7 days) so orphaned staging blobs from a partial Cosmos-write failure are cleaned up automatically.

#### Migration

See [`docs/conversation-storage-v2-migration.md`](./conversation-storage-v2-migration.md) for the full step-by-step operator guide. The short version:

1. Provision the v2 Cosmos container and the blob-offload container (with the `staging/` lifecycle rule).
2. Deploy a build that contains the v2 code. Leave `NEO_CONVERSATION_STORE_MODE=v1` — v2 code paths stay idle.
3. Flip to `dual-write` and monitor `conversation_dual_write_divergence` for 24 hours.
4. Run the migration. In prod: SSH into the App Service (`az webapp ssh -g neo-rg -n neo-web`) and execute `node dist/migrate.mjs --dry-run` (the bundle ships with every deploy; no install needed). Locally: `cd web && npm run migrate:conversations -- --dry-run`. Review the summary, then re-run without `--dry-run`. The script is idempotent — `migrated: true` markers on v1 docs + v2 pre-existence checks make re-runs safe.
5. Flip to `dual-read`. v1 fallback catches any conversations the migration missed.
6. Flip to `v2` once the fallback-to-v1 log signal is at zero.

Rollback is symmetric: flip the mode backward one step at a time. For conversations created while pure `v2` was active, `npm run migrate:conversations -- --direction v2-to-v1` rebuilds them for v1 with a 2 MB pre-flight rejection for oversized rebuilds.

### Without Cosmos DB

If `COSMOS_ENDPOINT` is not set (or `MOCK_MODE` is `true`), Neo falls back to the in-memory session store. A warning is logged once at startup. Conversations are not persisted across server restarts, and the web UI sidebar will not show conversation history.

---

## Prompt Injection Guard

Neo scans user messages and tool results for prompt injection patterns — attempts to override the agent's instructions, claim elevated privileges, bypass the confirmation gate, or smuggle directives through external API data.

### Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `monitor` (default) | Detections are logged to the audit trail but all requests are allowed through. Use this to calibrate false-positive rates against real SOC analyst traffic before enabling blocking. |
| `block` | Requests with 2 or more pattern matches are rejected with a generic 400 error. Single-pattern matches are still allowed through to avoid blocking legitimate queries that happen to trigger one heuristic. |

Set the mode via the `INJECTION_GUARD_MODE` environment variable:

```bash
INJECTION_GUARD_MODE=monitor   # Log only (recommended default)
INJECTION_GUARD_MODE=block     # Reject 2+ pattern matches
```

### What is scanned

**User input patterns** (applied to messages from the web API and Teams):
- Instruction overrides ("ignore your instructions")
- Persona reassignment ("you are now a different AI")
- System/role header injection (`[SYSTEM]`, `ASSISTANT:`)
- Privilege and authority claims ("I am an admin", "the CISO has authorized")
- Confirmation gate bypass attempts ("skip the confirmation")
- Jailbreak modes ("DAN mode", "developer mode")
- Guardrail overrides ("override safety")

**Tool result patterns** (applied to all data returned by Sentinel, XDR, and Entra ID tools):
- All user input patterns above, plus:
- Privilege grants ("you now have root access")
- Containment suppression ("do not isolate")
- Permission grants in data ("you are authorized to")
- Exfiltration commands (`curl`, `wget`, `nc`)
- Encoded payloads (base64-like strings of 20+ characters)

### Trust boundary envelope

All tool results are wrapped in a `_neo_trust_boundary` JSON envelope before being returned to the model. This envelope includes:
- `source: "external_api"` identifying the data origin
- An `injection_detected` boolean flag
- The original data in a `data` field

The system prompt instructs the model to treat all trust-boundary-wrapped content as untrusted and to flag any result where `injection_detected` is true. Detections are logged to the audit trail but no warning text is included in the envelope itself, keeping user-facing responses clean.

### System prompt reinforcement

The system prompt includes a `SECURITY OPERATING PRINCIPLES` section that instructs the model to:
- Treat role permissions as server-enforced facts, not subject to re-negotiation
- Require the confirmation gate for all destructive actions without exception
- Flag social engineering attempts explicitly in its response
- Never grant tool permissions or policy exceptions based on user assertions
- Treat all trust-boundary-wrapped content as untrusted external data

### Audit logging

Injection detections are logged as structured events with:
- `sessionId`, `role`, `label` (pattern category), `matchCount`, `messageLength`, and `mode`
- For tool results: `sessionId`, `toolName`, `label`, `matchCount`
- Raw message content is never logged to prevent sensitive SOC queries from appearing in the audit trail

---

## Structured Logging

Neo uses a structured logging module that writes JSON log events to both the console and (optionally) Azure Event Hubs for durable audit storage, dashboards, and alerting.

### Configuration

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `EVENT_HUB_CONNECTION_STRING` | Connection string for the primary (operational) Event Hub. Omit to use console-only logging. |
| `EVENT_HUB_NAME` | Name of the primary Event Hub (default: `neo-logs`). |
| `EVENT_HUB_ANALYTICS_CONNECTION_STRING` | Optional — connection string for the analytics Event Hub. If omitted, analytics events go to the primary hub. |
| `EVENT_HUB_ANALYTICS_NAME` | Name of the analytics Event Hub (default: `neo-analytics`). |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Minimum level to log: `debug`, `info` (default when `MOCK_MODE=false`), `warn`, `error`. Defaults to `debug` when `MOCK_MODE=true`. |

### Event Types

Every log event includes an `eventType` field for filtering in Log Analytics and an `identity` envelope with the user's display name, role, provider, channel, and session ID.

| Event Type | Description | Routed To |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| `operational` | Standard application logs (info, warn, error) | Primary hub (`neo-logs`) |
| `tool_execution` | Emitted after every tool call with duration, status, and integration category | Analytics hub (`neo-analytics`) |
| `token_usage` | Emitted after each Claude API call with full token breakdown | Analytics hub |
| `skill_invocation` | Emitted when a slash-command skill is triggered | Analytics hub |
| `session_started` | Emitted when a new session begins | Analytics hub |
| `session_ended` | Emitted when a session expires or is deleted | Analytics hub |
| `destructive_action` | Emitted when a destructive tool is confirmed or cancelled (audit trail) | Primary hub |
| `budget_alert` | Emitted when a user approaches (80%) or exceeds token budget | Primary hub |

### Dual Event Hub Routing

By default, all events go to a single Event Hub topic. Optionally deploy a second hub for high-volume analytics events to keep the operational table lean:

- **`neo-logs`** (primary): `operational`, `destructive_action`, `budget_alert`
- **`neo-analytics`** (optional): `tool_execution`, `token_usage`, `skill_invocation`, `session_started`, `session_ended`

If `EVENT_HUB_ANALYTICS_CONNECTION_STRING` is not set, all events gracefully fall back to the primary hub — no data is lost.

### Identity Envelope

Every event includes an `identity` object automatically populated from the request context:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `userName` | Human-readable display name (e.g., "{{team.manager.name}}") |
| `userIdHash` | SHA-256 hash of the AAD object ID (16 hex chars, for privacy-safe correlation) |
| `role` | `admin` or `reader` |
| `provider` | `entra-id` or `api-key` |
| `channel` | `web`, `cli`, or `teams` |
| `sessionId` | Current session UUID |

Note: `userName` is logged as the raw display name (not hashed) for dashboard readability. `userIdHash` provides privacy-safe correlation across events.

### Behavior

- **Console sink**: Always active. In development, all levels are printed. In production (`NODE_ENV=production`), only `warn` and `error` appear on the console. Structured events always appear in console.
- **Event Hub sink**: Enabled when `EVENT_HUB_CONNECTION_STRING` and `EVENT_HUB_NAME` are set. Events are buffered and flushed every 5 seconds or at 50 events, whichever comes first.
- **Graceful shutdown**: On `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT`, the logger flushes both buffers and closes all Event Hub connections.

### Metadata Redaction

Log metadata is filtered through an allowlist (`SAFE_METADATA_FIELDS`). Only explicitly allowed fields pass through to logs. Fields containing PII (like `ownerId` and `aadObjectId`) are one-way hashed with SHA-256 before logging.

### Provisioning

**Primary Event Hub** (required for Event Hub logging):

```powershell
./scripts/provision-event-hub.ps1
```

Creates an Event Hub Namespace, Hub (`neo-logs`, 2 partitions, 1-day retention), and a Send-only authorization rule.

**Analytics Event Hub** (optional — for splitting high-volume events):

```powershell
./scripts/provision-analytics-event-hub.ps1
```

Creates a second Event Hub (`neo-analytics`) within the existing namespace. Requires `provision-event-hub.ps1` to have been run first.

### Log Analytics Table Schema

When using the Log Analytics custom table (`NeoLogs_CL`), the schema includes:

| Column | Type | Source |
|--------|------|--------|
| `TimeGenerated` | datetime | `LogEntry.timestamp` |
| `Level` | string | `LogEntry.level` |
| `Component` | string | `LogEntry.component` |
| `Message` | string | `LogEntry.message` |
| `EventType` | string | `LogEntry.eventType` |
| `Identity` | dynamic | `LogEntry.identity` (userName, role, provider, channel, sessionId) |
| `Metadata` | dynamic | `LogEntry.metadata` (PII-sanitized key-value pairs) |

### Example KQL Queries for Dashboards

```kql
// Destructive actions audit trail
NeoLogs_CL
| where EventType == "destructive_action"
| project TimeGenerated, User=Identity.userName, Role=Identity.role,
          Tool=Metadata.toolName, Confirmed=Metadata.confirmed,
          Justification=Metadata.justification
| order by TimeGenerated desc

## Azure Deployment

PowerShell scripts in `scripts/` handle Azure infrastructure provisioning and application deployment. All scripts are idempotent — safe to re-run without creating duplicates.

### Prerequisites

All scripts require:

- **Azure CLI** (`az`) installed — [Install guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- **Logged in** to Azure CLI: `az login`
- **Correct subscription** selected: `az account set --subscription <id>`

The deploy script additionally requires **npm** installed locally.

### 1. Provision App Service

`scripts/provision-azure.ps1` creates the Azure App Service infrastructure: Resource Group, Linux App Service Plan, and Web App configured for Node.js.

```powershell
# Default — creates neo-rg, neo-plan (B1), neo-web
./scripts/provision-azure.ps1

# Production — custom name, higher SKU, different region
./scripts/provision-azure.ps1 -WebAppName "neo-prod" -Sku "P1v3" -Location "westus2"
```

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `-ResourceGroupName` | `neo-rg` | Azure Resource Group name |
| `-AppServicePlanName` | `neo-plan` | App Service Plan name |
| `-WebAppName` | `neo-web` | Web App name (becomes `<name>.azurewebsites.net`) |
| `-Location` | `eastus` | Azure region |
| `-Sku` | `B1` | App Service Plan tier (`B1`, `B2`, `B3`, `S1`–`S3`, `P1v2`–`P3v3`) |
| `-NodeVersion` | `20-lts` | Node.js runtime version (`20-lts` or `22-lts`) |

The script automatically configures:
- `MOCK_MODE=false`, `INJECTION_GUARD_MODE=monitor`, and `TEAMS_BOT_ROLE=reader` as app settings
- Startup command: `node server.js`
- HTTPS-only with TLS 1.2 minimum

### 2. Provision Cosmos DB (Optional)

`scripts/provision-cosmos-db.ps1` creates the Azure Cosmos DB infrastructure for chat persistence. Skip this step if you only need in-memory sessions.

```powershell
# Default — creates neo-cosmos-db (serverless), neo-db database, conversations container
./scripts/provision-cosmos-db.ps1

# Production — custom account name
./scripts/provision-cosmos-db.ps1 -AccountName "neo-prod-cosmos" -Location "westus2"
```

The script outputs the endpoint URL. Add it to your app settings (see step 6).

For full parameter reference, see [Chat Persistence — Provisioning](#provisioning).

### 3. Provision Event Hub (Optional)

`scripts/provision-event-hub.ps1` creates the Azure Event Hub infrastructure for structured audit logging. Skip this step if you only need console logging.

```powershell
# Default — creates neo-eventhub-ns (Basic), neo-logs hub, Send-only auth rule
./scripts/provision-event-hub.ps1

# Production — Standard tier, custom namespace
./scripts/provision-event-hub.ps1 -NamespaceName "neo-prod-eventhub-ns" -Sku "Standard" -Location "westus2"
```

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `-ResourceGroupName` | `neo-rg` | Azure Resource Group name (reuses existing) |
| `-NamespaceName` | `neo-eventhub-ns` | Event Hub Namespace name |
| `-EventHubName` | `neo-logs` | Event Hub name |
| `-Location` | `eastus` | Azure region |
| `-Sku` | `Basic` | Namespace tier (`Basic` or `Standard`) |
| `-PartitionCount` | `2` | Number of partitions (1–32) |
| `-MessageRetentionDays` | `1` | Message retention in days (1–7) |
| `-AuthRuleName` | `neo-send-policy` | Name of the Send-only authorization rule |

The script outputs the connection string at the end. Add it to your `.env` or app settings:

```bash
EVENT_HUB_CONNECTION_STRING="<connection-string-from-script-output>"
EVENT_HUB_NAME="neo-logs"
```

**Optional: Analytics Event Hub** — To split high-volume analytics events into a separate hub (recommended for production):

```powershell
# Creates neo-analytics hub within the existing namespace
./scripts/provision-analytics-event-hub.ps1
```

Add the output to `.env`:

```bash
EVENT_HUB_ANALYTICS_CONNECTION_STRING="<connection-string-from-script-output>"
EVENT_HUB_ANALYTICS_NAME="neo-analytics"
```

If not provisioned, all events go to the primary `neo-logs` hub — no data is lost.

### 4. Provision Blob Storage for CLI Downloads (Optional)

Create an Azure Storage account and container for hosting CLI installer files. Skip this step if you don't need the web-based download page.

```powershell
# Create a storage account (LRS, hot tier)
az storage account create \
    --name neoclireleases \
    --resource-group neo-rg \
    --location eastus \
    --sku Standard_LRS \
    --kind StorageV2

# Create the container
az storage container create \
    --name cli-releases \
    --account-name neoclireleases

# Assign Storage Blob Data Reader to the App Service managed identity
$principalId = az webapp identity show \
    --name neo-web \
    --resource-group neo-rg \
    --query principalId -o tsv

az role assignment create \
    --role "Storage Blob Data Reader" \
    --assignee $principalId \
    --scope "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/neo-rg/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/neoclireleases"
```

After creating the storage account, set `CLI_STORAGE_ACCOUNT=neoclireleases` in your app settings (see step 6).

**File upload containers (web chat attachments)**: if you want the web UI to accept images, PDFs, and CSVs, create the two upload containers in the same storage account and grant the App Service identity `Storage Blob Data Contributor`. Full commands and behavior are in [File Uploads (Web)](#file-uploads-web).

<a id="provision-csv-cleanup-function"></a>
### 5. Provision CSV Cleanup Function (Optional)

`scripts/provision-csv-cleanup.ps1` creates a timer-triggered Azure Function that runs daily at 03:00 UTC to delete orphaned CSV blobs from the `neo-csv-uploads` container. A blob is orphaned when its parent conversation has been deleted by Cosmos TTL. Skip this step if you are not using CSV uploads.

```powershell
# Default — creates neo-csv-cleanup Function App
./scripts/provision-csv-cleanup.ps1

# Production — custom names
./scripts/provision-csv-cleanup.ps1 `
    -FunctionAppName "neo-csv-cleanup-prod" `
    -CosmosAccountName "neo-cosmos-prod" `
    -StorageAccountName "neoclireleases"
```

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `-ResourceGroupName` | `neo-rg` | Azure Resource Group name |
| `-FunctionAppName` | `neo-csv-cleanup` | Function App name |
| `-StorageAccountName` | `neoclireleases` | Storage account containing the CSV container |
| `-CsvContainerName` | `neo-csv-uploads` | Blob container for CSV uploads |
| `-CosmosAccountName` | `neo-cosmos` | Cosmos DB account name |
| `-CosmosDatabase` | `neo-db` | Cosmos DB database name |
| `-CosmosContainer` | `conversations` | Cosmos DB container holding conversations |
| `-Location` | `eastus` | Azure region |
| `-SkipDeploy` | (off) | Provision infrastructure only, skip function deployment |

The script automatically:
- Creates a Consumption-plan Function App with Node.js 20 and system-assigned Managed Identity
- Assigns **Cosmos DB Built-in Data Reader** scoped to the `conversations` container
- Assigns **Storage Blob Data Contributor** scoped to the CSV container
- Configures app settings (Cosmos endpoint, database, container, storage account, CSV container)
- Builds and deploys the function from `functions/csv-cleanup/`

### 6. Provision Log Analytics Custom Table (Optional)

`scripts/provision-log-analytics.ps1` creates a custom Log Analytics table (`NeoLogs_CL`) and a Data Collection Rule (DCR) for ingesting structured application logs. Skip this step if you only need Event Hub or console logging.

The table schema maps directly to the `LogEntry` interface in `web/lib/logger.ts`:

| Column | Type | Source |
|--------|------|--------|
| `TimeGenerated` | datetime | `LogEntry.timestamp` |
| `Level` | string | `LogEntry.level` (debug, info, warn, error) |
| `Component` | string | `LogEntry.component` |
| `Message` | string | `LogEntry.message` |
| `EventType` | string | `LogEntry.eventType` (operational, tool_execution, token_usage, etc.) |
| `Identity` | dynamic | `LogEntry.identity` (userName, userIdHash, role, provider, channel, sessionId) |
| `Metadata` | dynamic | `LogEntry.metadata` (PII-sanitized key-value pairs) |

**Prerequisites**: A Log Analytics workspace must already exist. If you don't have one, create it first:

```powershell
az monitor log-analytics workspace create `
    --resource-group neo-rg `
    --workspace-name neo-log-workspace `
    --location eastus
```

**Run the script**:

```powershell
# Default — creates NeoLogs_CL table, DCE, and DCR in neo-log-workspace
./scripts/provision-log-analytics.ps1

# Custom workspace, region, and retention
./scripts/provision-log-analytics.ps1 -WorkspaceName "neo-prod-workspace" -Location "westus2" -RetentionDays 90 -TotalRetentionDays 365
```

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `-ResourceGroupName` | `neo-rg` | Azure Resource Group name (reuses existing) |
| `-WorkspaceName` | `neo-log-workspace` | Existing Log Analytics workspace name |
| `-Location` | `eastus` | Azure region |
| `-TableName` | `NeoLogs_CL` | Custom table name (must end in `_CL`) |
| `-DcrName` | `neo-logs-dcr` | Data Collection Rule name |
| `-RetentionDays` | `30` | Interactive retention in days (30–730) |
| `-TotalRetentionDays` | `90` | Total retention including cold storage (30–2556) |

The script creates three resources:

1. **Custom table** (`NeoLogs_CL`) in the Log Analytics workspace with the schema above.
2. **Data Collection Endpoint (DCE)** — provides the HTTPS ingestion URL.
3. **Data Collection Rule (DCR)** — defines the incoming stream, maps it to the workspace, and includes a KQL transform that renames the camelCase application fields to PascalCase table columns.

The script outputs the DCE endpoint URL, DCR immutable ID, and stream name needed for log ingestion. To query the table after logs are flowing:

```kql
NeoLogs_CL
| where Level == "error"
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

### 7. Set Secret Environment Variables

After provisioning, set the secret app settings that the provisioning script does not set (secrets should not be passed as script parameters):

```powershell
az webapp config appsettings set `
    --name neo-web `
    --resource-group neo-rg `
    --settings `
        ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="<your-key>" `
        AUTH_SECRET="<openssl rand -hex 32>" `
        AZURE_TENANT_ID="<tenant-id>" `
        AZURE_CLIENT_ID="<client-id>" `
        AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET="<client-secret>" `
        AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<subscription-id>" `
        SENTINEL_WORKSPACE_ID="<workspace-id>" `
        SENTINEL_WORKSPACE_NAME="<workspace-name>" `
        SENTINEL_RESOURCE_GROUP="<resource-group>" `
        AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_ID="<entra-client-id>" `
        AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_SECRET="<entra-secret>" `
        AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_ISSUER="<entra-issuer>"
```

If you provisioned Cosmos DB, also add:

```powershell
az webapp config appsettings set `
    --name neo-web `
    --resource-group neo-rg `
    --settings `
        COSMOS_ENDPOINT="https://<account-name>.documents.azure.com:443/"
```

If you provisioned Event Hub, also add:

```powershell
az webapp config appsettings set `
    --name neo-web `
    --resource-group neo-rg `
    --settings `
        EVENT_HUB_CONNECTION_STRING="<connection-string>" `
        EVENT_HUB_NAME="neo-logs"
```

If you provisioned Blob Storage for CLI downloads, also add:

```powershell
az webapp config appsettings set \
    --name neo-web \
    --resource-group neo-rg \
    --settings \
        CLI_STORAGE_ACCOUNT="neoclireleases"
```

### 8. Build and Deploy

`scripts/deploy-azure.ps1` builds the Next.js app in standalone mode and deploys it to the existing Azure Web App via zip deploy.

```powershell
# Default — builds and deploys to neo-web
./scripts/deploy-azure.ps1

# Deploy to a different app name
./scripts/deploy-azure.ps1 -WebAppName "neo-prod"

# Skip build (reuse previous build output)
./scripts/deploy-azure.ps1 -SkipBuild
```

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `-ResourceGroupName` | `neo-rg` | Azure Resource Group name |
| `-WebAppName` | `neo-web` | Target Web App name |
| `-SkipBuild` | (off) | Skip `npm install` and `npm run build`, reuse existing `.next/standalone/` output |

The script packages the Next.js standalone output, `public/` assets, `.next/static/`, and `skills/` into a zip file and deploys via `az webapp deploy`. The `-SkipBuild` flag is useful for redeploying without rebuilding (e.g., after changing only app settings). It warns if the build artifact is more than 24 hours old.

The Web App must already exist — run `provision-azure.ps1` first.

### 9. Add a Custom Domain (Optional)

`scripts/add-custom-domain.ps1` binds a custom internal domain to the App Service, uploads a TLS certificate, and registers the OAuth redirect URI in Entra ID. The existing `*.azurewebsites.net` domain remains fully functional.

```powershell
$pw = Read-Host -Prompt "PFX password" -AsSecureString
./scripts/add-custom-domain.ps1 `
    -CustomDomain "neo.companyname.com" `
    -PfxPath "./certs/neo.pfx" `
    -PfxPassword $pw `
    -EntraAppId "your-entra-app-client-id"
```

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `-CustomDomain` | (required) | The custom domain to bind (e.g., `neo.companyname.com`) |
| `-PfxPath` | (required) | Path to the PFX certificate file |
| `-PfxPassword` | (required) | Password for the PFX file |
| `-ResourceGroupName` | `neo-rg` | Azure Resource Group name |
| `-WebAppName` | `neo-web` | App Service name |
| `-EntraAppId` | (optional) | Entra ID application ID for auto-registering redirect URIs |

**Prerequisites before running**:

1. **DNS**: Create a CNAME record pointing your custom domain to `<WebAppName>.azurewebsites.net`, or an A record pointing to the App Service IP. Also add the TXT verification record (`asuid.<custom-domain>`).
2. **Certificate**: Have your TLS certificate ready as a PFX file. Since internal domains are not publicly resolvable, Azure managed certificates cannot be used — you must supply your own.
3. **Entra ID redirect URI**: The script can auto-register the new redirect URI if you provide `-EntraAppId`. Otherwise, manually add `https://<custom-domain>/api/auth/callback/microsoft-entra-id` in the Entra ID app registration under Authentication > Redirect URIs. **Only the custom-domain redirect URI is needed** — the `azurewebsites.net` URI should be removed to avoid confusion (see below).

**How the two domains divide responsibilities**:

- **Custom domain (`neo.companyname.com`)** — the canonical host for **humans**. All interactive OAuth login goes through this domain. Set `AUTH_URL=https://neo.companyname.com` in your App Service settings so Auth.js pins the callback URL deterministically. This is required — Auth.js cannot safely derive the callback from the request Host header on Azure App Service, because internal container routing can inject bogus hostnames (e.g. `<container-id>.<port>`) that Entra rejects.
- **`azurewebsites.net` domain** — the fallback specifically for the **Teams bot** (and any other external integration with its own auth mechanism). Teams requests hit `/api/teams/*`, which validates Bot Framework JWTs at the handler level and never invokes Auth.js OAuth. So Auth.js being pinned to the custom domain does not break Teams.
- CSP (`connect-src 'self'`) and CSRF origin checks are domain-agnostic — they match whichever domain the request arrives on.
- CLI users on the internal network should set `NEO_SERVER=https://neo.companyname.com`. The CLI uses a separate public-client OAuth flow (`http://localhost:4000/callback`), not the web Auth.js flow, so it works against either domain.

---

## Building the Windows Installer

The CLI can be packaged as a standalone `neo.exe` using Node.js Single Executable Applications (SEA) and distributed as a signed Windows installer. Users do not need Node.js installed.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22+** (SEA support)
- **Inno Setup 6** — [Download](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php) (free)
- **Code-signing certificate** in `Cert:\CurrentUser\My` (optional — use `-SkipSign` for unsigned dev builds)
- **Windows SDK** with `signtool.exe` on PATH (for removing Node's embedded signature)

### Build Pipeline

From the `cli/` directory:

```bash
# Install dev dependencies (esbuild)
npm install

# Full release build (bundle → SEA → sign exe → installer → sign installer)
npm run release
```

This produces:
- `cli/dist/neo.exe` — Standalone CLI executable
- `cli/dist/NeoSetup-<version>.exe` — Signed Inno Setup installer

### Individual Build Steps

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `npm run build:bundle` | Bundle ES modules into a single CJS file via esbuild |
| `npm run build:sea` | Generate SEA blob and inject into a copy of `node.exe` |
| `npm run build:sign` | Sign `dist/neo.exe` with Authenticode |
| `npm run build:installer` | Compile Inno Setup installer and sign it |
| `npm run release` | Run all steps in sequence |

### Code Signing

The build uses `Set-AuthenticodeSignature` with the first code-signing certificate found in `Cert:\CurrentUser\My` and timestamps via DigiCert (`http://timestamp.digicert.com`). Both `neo.exe` and the installer are signed.

For unsigned dev builds, call the signing script directly with `-SkipSign`:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build/sign.ps1 -FilePath dist/neo.exe -SkipSign
```

### What the Installer Does

- Installs `neo.exe` to `Program Files\Neo`
- Adds the install directory to the system PATH
- Registers an uninstaller in Windows Settings
- Version number is read from `cli/package.json`

### Version Numbering

The installer version is pulled from `cli/package.json`. Update the `version` field there before building a release:

```json
{
  "version": "1.1.0"
}
```

### Uploading to Blob Storage

After building, upload the installer to your Azure Blob Storage container:

```bash
az storage blob upload \
    --account-name neoclireleases \
    --container-name cli-releases \
    --name neo-setup.exe \
    --file cli/dist/NeoSetup-1.0.0.exe \
    --overwrite
```

The web app's `/downloads` page will immediately serve the updated installer — no redeployment required.

---

## Client-Side Storage

The web interface stores user preferences in the browser's `localStorage`. These values are not sent to the server or persisted in Cosmos DB.

| Key | Values | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| `neo-theme` | `light`, `dark`, `auto` | Color mode preference. `auto` follows OS system preference. Default: `auto`. |
| `neo-display-name` | String (max 50 chars) | Optional display name shown in the settings profile section. Falls back to the Entra ID full name when empty. |

These values are managed via the Settings page (`/settings`), accessible from the gear icon in the chat sidebar.

---

## Security Notes

- **API keys** are compared using timing-safe comparison to prevent enumeration attacks.
- **CLI credentials** are encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM. The encryption key is derived from the local machine's username and hostname via scrypt with a random per-install salt. Credentials are not portable between machines.
- **HTTPS enforcement**: The CLI rejects plain HTTP connections to non-localhost servers.
- **Token refresh**: Entra ID tokens are refreshed automatically. If the refresh token expires, you will need to run `auth login` again.
- **File permissions**: `~/.neo/config.json` is created with `0600` (owner-only). The directory is `0700`.
- **Session ownership**: Each agent session is tied to the identity that created it. Only the owner or an admin can access or delete a session. Cosmos DB conversations use the immutable AAD Object ID (`oid` claim) as the partition key, ensuring ownership cannot change if a user's display name is updated.
- **Prompt injection guard**: User messages and tool results are scanned for adversarial patterns. Detections are logged but never include raw message content. See [Prompt Injection Guard](#prompt-injection-guard).
- **Audit logging**: Structured events (authentication, tool calls, confirmations, injection detections) are sent to Azure Event Hub. PII fields are one-way hashed before logging. See [Structured Logging](#structured-logging).

## Supply Chain Hardening

Neo defends against npm supply chain attacks (like the [March 2026 axios compromise](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2026/04/01/mitigating-the-axios-npm-supply-chain-compromise/)) with four layers of defense:

### 1. Pinned direct dependencies

All direct dependencies in `web/package.json` and `cli/package.json` are pinned to **exact versions** with no caret (`^`) or tilde (`~`) ranges. This prevents `npm update` or a stale lockfile from silently pulling in newer versions without explicit review.

To update a dependency safely:
1. Bump the version in `package.json`
2. Run `npm install` locally to update `package-lock.json`
3. Run `npm audit` to verify no new vulnerabilities
4. Commit both `package.json` and `package-lock.json` together

### 2. Transitive dependency overrides

`web/package.json` includes an `overrides` section that force-pins high-risk transitive dependencies regardless of what parent packages request. Currently overridden:

- `axios` — pinned to a known-safe version (skips compromised `1.14.1` and `0.30.4`)
- `fast-xml-parser` — pinned to a patched version (CVE-fixed)

When updating these overrides, verify the new version against the [GitHub Advisory Database](https://github.com/advisories) and the npm registry.

### 3. `npm ci` for production deploys

The Azure deploy script (`scripts/deploy-azure.ps1`) uses `npm ci` instead of `npm install`. `npm ci` installs exactly what's in `package-lock.json` and **fails fast** if the lockfile and `package.json` disagree. This prevents a compromised package from sneaking in via a transitive dep update during deploy.

If you see `npm ci failed: lockfile out of sync` during deploy, it means someone modified `package.json` without running `npm install` locally. Run `npm install` locally to regenerate the lockfile and commit both files together.

### 4. `min-release-age` cooling-off period

Both `web/.npmrc` and `cli/.npmrc` set `min-release-age=4320` (72 hours, in minutes). npm 11+ refuses to install package versions younger than this threshold, giving the security community time to detect and report compromised releases before they enter our dependency tree. The 2026 axios compromise was unpublished within ~3 hours, so a 72-hour buffer would have entirely prevented it from affecting users with this setting enabled.

You may see an `Unknown project config "min-release-age"` warning on older npm 11 minor versions — the value is still applied, the warning will go away when npm catches up to 11.12+.

To install a brand-new version urgently (e.g., a critical security patch published yesterday), temporarily set `min-release-age=0` in `.npmrc`, install, then revert.

### Verifying clean state

After any dependency change, run:

```bash
cd web && npm audit                                    # Should report 0 vulnerabilities
grep -B1 '"version":' package-lock.json | grep -A1 '"node_modules/axios"'  # Should be ≥1.15.0, never 1.14.1 or 0.30.4
grep -c '"plain-crypto-js"' package-lock.json          # Must return 0 — known supply chain payload
```
